/*
A linked List is a type of structure that holds a node and points to the next node.
    It can be implmented in a struct or using class
    I saw this being used on Sidia. Where they implement a test executor on the soundbar. 
    The tests were writen in this kid of struct. it contained the information of the current test and pointed to the next test
    the main advantage is that you can easily add, insert or remove an item from the list
A second option is use double linked list, this structure points not only to the next node but also for the previuos one.
    It brings more versatility to the list, with double list you also can insert a node before another node,
    but it will consume more memory than the linked list*/
