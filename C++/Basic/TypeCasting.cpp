/*
    Type casting is the hability to tranform the type of a variable. There are two modes of casting
        *Implicit cast
        *Explicit cast
    Implicit cast ocurr every time the you assing one variable to another variable with a diferente type.
    Explicit cast ocurr when you explicit tells to the compiler how to convert the variable
        * static_cast
        * dynamic_cast
        * const cast
        * Reinterpret cast
        * Assigment oprator -> ()
*/

/*Static Cast. It is executed during the compile time and you have to assure that this cast is valid cast.*/
/*Dynamic Cast. It is executed during the runtime and is used to cast pointers and references.
 If the convertion fails itÂ´ll return NULL
 dynamic_cast<New type>(old type pointer)*/
